//! Batten is a repo-agnostic policy engine.
//!
//! It gates what gets written, proves what was verified, and refuses to let
//! unlanded work appear finished — enforcing one repository's policy consistently
//! at the pre-commit layer, in CI, and at an agent's tool call.
//!
//! This crate exposes the library surface ([`run`]) that the `batten` binary is a
//! thin wrapper around. Keeping the logic in the library keeps it testable and
//! keeps the binary's `main` trivial.
