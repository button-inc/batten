# land-lock: the rolling lease that serialises landing (CLOUD-393). The whole
# point of the task is an atomicity claim — two sessions must not both hold it —
# and a stubbed git cannot test that claim at all, since the atomicity IS git's.
# So the remote here is a real bare repository and the pushes are real pushes:
# these tests exercise the same create-is-test-and-set and
# --force-with-lease-is-CAS behaviour that was measured against GitHub.
#
# The one stub is `gh`, because releasing goes through the REST API rather than a
# delete-push (the agent proxy 403s the latter). The stub performs the equivalent
# `update-ref -d` on the bare repo, so the delete is real too.
#
# A rival session is modelled as a second working clone: the holder id lives in
# each clone's own git dir, so two clones are two identities, which is exactly
# what the remote sees.
